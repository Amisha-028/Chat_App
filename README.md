# Real-Time Chat Application using MERN Stack

## Description

This project is a real-time messaging application built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The application incorporates several additional technologies to enhance the user experience and functionality. Users can sign up, log in, and chat with each other in real-time. Secure authentication and authorization are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The frontend is designed with TailwindCSS and Daisy UI, providing a modern and responsive user interface. Real-time communication is facilitated by Socket.io, and online user status is managed through a combination of Socket.io and React Context.Global state management is handled using Zustand, making state handling efficient throughout the application. Both server-side and client-side error handling are implemented to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience. The application is easy to deploy, enabling users to set it up like a pro for free. Additionally, it includes many other features to offer a complete messaging experience.
